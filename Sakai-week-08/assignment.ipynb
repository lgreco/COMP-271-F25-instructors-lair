    "* Simple hashing - hotel with 26 rooms, labeled A-Z. Guests are assigned to room based on their first name initial. If room occupied guest is not admitted.\n",
    "* Not a good business model. Lots of demand for room `J` and `M` because John, Mary very popular names. Less demand for `X` or `Z`.\n",
    "* Superfast to tell if a person is a guest at the hotel. If room corresponding to person's first name initial is not empty, person with that present. $\\mathcal O(1)$.\n",
    "* Brief/simple intro to $\\mathcal O$ notation.\n",
    "* Many room remain empty. Introduce probing. John goes to `J`. James cannot go to `J` because John is there but what if the next room `K` is available. James can go there. Now, it may take 2 steps to find if James is in hotel. We expect him in `J` but we'll also probe `K`. Still faster than linear search or binary search. \n",
    "* Eventually we'll end up underutilizing the hotel. So we reach a compromise, to underutilize storage for the sake of performance.\n",
    "* Demonstrate with a hotel (a list, really) with 1000 rooms where guests are send to a room based on some hash function.\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem showcases several classic hashing gotchas in one go. What we typically observe for N = 1024:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sum-based hash: OK-ish but not great. With random letters and variable lengths, we see a distribution that looks somewhat uniform but carries low-bit patterns; the collision count is often worse than ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Product-based hash: Disastrously bad with a power-of-two table size. Most names end up in bucket 0 (or a tiny set of buckets). Collisions skyrocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polynomial (base 31)-based hash: Best of the three. We see collisions close to the uniform baseline.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{E}[\\text{collisions}]\n",
    "= m - N\\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{N}\\right)^{m}\\right).\n",

    "\\approx \\frac{N}{e}\n",
    "\\approx 0.368\\,N.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these outcomes happen**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sum-based hash: Modulo a power of two keeps only the lowest 10 bits of the sum. ASCII letters share high-bit patterns; the low bits of `ord` aren’t perfectly uniform (for `A`..`Z`, they range 1–26). Summing several such values tends toward uniformity by convolution, but low-bit periodicity and length coupling remain, so we get noticeable bias and more collisions than ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Product-based hash: Catastrophic with $N=2^{10}$. Each even character contributes at least one factor of 2. For uppercase/lowercase letters, the expected 2-adic valuation per letter is about 0.885; after only ~12 characters the product tends to be divisible by $2^{10}$. Result: the hash is very often 0, flooding one bucket → massive collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polynomial-based hash: Multiplies by an odd base (31) and adds each `ord`, effectively mixing positions and values.\n",
    "With $N=2^{10}$ and odd base (31) coprime to $N$, this scheme spreads mass much more evenly, so collision counts land close to the uniform baseline.\n",
