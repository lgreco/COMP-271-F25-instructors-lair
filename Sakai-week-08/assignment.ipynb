    "- Simple hashing - hotel with 26 rooms, labeled A-Z. Guests are assigned to room based on their first name initial. If room occupied guest is not admitted.\n",
    "- Not a good business model. Lots of demand for room `J` and `M` because John, Mary very popular names. Less demand for `X` or `Z`.\n",
    "- Superfast to tell if a person is a guest at the hotel. If room corresponding to person's first name initial is not empty, person with that present. $\\mathcal O(1)$.\n",
    "- Brief/simple intro to $\\mathcal O$ notation.\n",
    "- Many room remain empty. Introduce probing. John goes to `J`. James cannot go to `J` because John is there but what if the next room `K` is available. James can go there. Now, it may take 2 steps to find if James is in hotel. We expect him in `J` but we'll also probe `K`. Still faster than linear search or binary search.\n",
    "- Discuss probing.\n",
    "- Probing requires that we take over rooms that should be available for other guests.\n",
    "- How about moving roll-in beds to a room as more guest with the same name initial arrive at the hotel (ok, it will get a bit crowded, but we are not a 5-star hotel).\n",
    "- Introduce simple module based hashing. Instead of a hotel with 26 rooms, for A, B, .., Z, use `ord(initial)%capacity` to determine room number.\n",
    "- In building a class (Hotel Alphabetical) discuss some standardized behavior (based on software contracts). For example, the objects must have an `exists -> bool` function. A `remove -> guest` etc.\n",
