* [Linked lists](./Linkedlists%20as%20trains/)

* [Exam 1](./MidtermExam/)

* [Week 6 assignment and solutions](./Sakai-week-06/assignment.ipynb)

* [Week 7 assignment and solutions](./Sakai-week-07/assignment.ipynb)

## Tentative outline

* Week 7: review of midterm problem and a quick linked list refresher (this is a short week due to fall break)
* Week 8: lists of linked lists: an introduction to hashtables. Emphasis on O(n) operations reduced to O(n/k) with k sufficient enough to justify O(1-ish). High level discussion of asymptotic behavior. (Chapter 21, Appendix G)
* Week 9: improvements on hashtables to deliver true O(1) time at the expense of O(too much) space. (Chapter 21, 16)
* Week 10: important algorithms: binary search, merge sort on linked lists and lists. Recursion. (Chapter 16, 17)
* Week 11: binary trees as arrays. Priority queues.(Chapter 18, 19)
* Week 12: Matrices and applications (Leo's notes and Berkeley notes on numerical methods with Python) [or we can substitute this part with AVL trees]
* Week 13: Preview of graphs -- adj. matrix representation (Chapter 22)
* Week 14: course review prep for final (TG break)
* Week 15: Interview practice, leet code problems, final prep.
