It cannot use any list techniques such as membership (`in`), `index`, `count` etc. In fact, the **only list operation allowed** is the indexed access, i.e., `values[i]` such as\n",

Your method should have a docstring describing how it works and it must be well documented Docstrings are brief narratives about the method itself.

In-line comments best to be avoided but if you need them, leave two spaces before the hash (and the one space after). These stylistic observations are so important that major tech shops have enshrined them in formal requirements. For example, Google requires their Python developers to follow a [certain style when coding](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
