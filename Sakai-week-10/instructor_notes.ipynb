    "In ${n(n+1)}/{2}$, the dominant term is $n^2$. For sufficient large values of $n$ we can say that $\\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}\\approx n^2$. Another way to say this is to write that the naive sorting technique belongs to the family of problems that can be solved in quadratic time. If $T(n)$ is the time required to perfored the naive sorting above, we write $T(n)\\in \\mathcal O(n^2)$ and in an abuse of notation, $T(n) = \\mathcal O(n^2)$. The mathematical definition is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) \\in \\mathcal O(n^2) \\Leftrightarrow \\exists k\\in\\mathbb R_{>0}, \\exists n_0 \\in \\mathbb Z: T(n) \\leq kn^2, \\forall n>n_0\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal O(n^2)$ is a subset of problems in the family of $\\mathcal O(n^d)$, when $d>0$ is a constant independent of the problem size $n$. This is the family of problems than can be solved in polynomial time ($n^d$ is viewed as the highest-degree term of some polynomial function $T(n) \\leq k(a_d n^d + a_{d-1} n^{d-1} +\\ldots + a_1n+a_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems that can be solved in polynomial time, whether $d=1000$ or $d=1$ are considered *easy* problems. A special case of polynomial time is when $d=0$: these are problems that can be solved in fixed time. Opposite to the polynomial-time family stands a family of hard-to solve problems. Usually they require exponential time such as $\\mathcal O (2^n)$, $\\mathcal O (n^{n-1})$, $\\mathcal O(n!)$, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy problem, i.e., a problem that can be solved in polynomial time may have an improved solution. Consider sorting: a naive method, can sort an array with $n$ elements in time proportional to $n^2$. For $n=8$ that's about 64 steps but for $n=1024$ that's about 1,058,576. Imagine if we could do better? If we could sort an array of size $n$ in approximately $n\\log_2 n$ steps. That would be 24 and 10,240 steps respectively. The savings, as $n$ becomes larger, are significant."
